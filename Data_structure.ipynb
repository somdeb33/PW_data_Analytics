    "3.  What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference bwtween List and tuple\n",
    "1. Mutability:\n",
    "Lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable.\n",
    "This means you can change, add, or remove elements in a list, but you cannot modify a tuple after it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax:\n",
    " Lists use square brackets [ ], whereas tuples use parentheses ( ).\n",
    "This means you define a list like [1, 2, 3] and a tuple like (1, 2, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Methods Available: \n",
    "Lists have many built-in methods, whereas tuples have very few.\n",
    "This means you can modify a list using methods like append(), pop(), or sort(), but tuples only support count() and index().\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance:\n",
    " Tuples are faster in performance than lists.\n",
    "This is because tuples are immutable and require less overhead, making them more efficient in fixed-size data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Memory Usage: Tuples use less memory than lists.\n",
    "Since tuples are fixed in size, they consume less memory than dynamic lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use Case: Lists are used when data can change, whereas tuples are used for fixed data.\n",
    "This means use lists for dynamic operations, and tuples when you want to protect data from modification.\n",

    "String: A string is a sequence of characters. Python treats anything inside quotes as a string. This includes letters, numbers, and symbols. Python has no character data type so single character is a string of length 1.\n",

    "4. Modification : You cannot directly change a character in a string, but you can change, add, or remove elements in a list.\n",
    "5. Operations : Strings have text-specific methods (upper(), replace(), split()), while lists have collection-specific methods (append(), remove(), sort()).\n",
    "6. Representation : Strings are written inside quotes (' ', \" \"), while lists are written inside square brackets [ ].\n",

    "1. Prevents accidental changes : Since tuples can’t be modified, your data stays exactly as it was when created.\n",

    "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks, mainly due to their key-value structure and efficient lookups:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast Lookups: Dictionaries provide very fast access to elements based on their keys, regardless of the size of the dictionary. Lists, on the other hand, require iterating through the list to find an element by its value (unless you know the index), which can be slow for large lists.\n",
    "Meaningful Access: Accessing data by a descriptive key (like a name or ID) is often more intuitive and readable than accessing data by a numerical index, especially when the order of items doesn't matter.\n",
    "Associative Arrays: Dictionaries are ideal for representing data where there is a natural association between pieces of information. For example, storing a person's attributes (name, age, city) where the attributes are the keys and the specific values are the data.\n",
    "No Need for Order: If the order of elements doesn't matter for your task, dictionaries are often a better choice. Lists maintain order, which can add overhead if you don't need it.\n",
    "Representing Structured Data: Dictionaries are excellent for representing structured data, similar to JSON objects. This makes them very useful when working with APIs or data formats that use key-value pairs.\n",
    "Here's a simple example comparing accessing data in a list versus a dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Using a list (lookup by value can be slow)\n",
    "person_list = [\"somdeb\", 25, \"Tinsukia\"]\n",

    "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list is when you need to represent a collection of items that should not be changed after they are created.\n",

    "Immutability for Hashing: As mentioned before, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets because they are immutable. If you wanted to store coordinates in a dictionary (e.g., mapping a location name to its coordinate), you could use the tuple as the key. You couldn't do this with a list.\n",
